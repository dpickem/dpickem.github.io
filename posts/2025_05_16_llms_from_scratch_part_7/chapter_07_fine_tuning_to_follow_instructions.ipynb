    "In addition to masking out padding tokens, it is also common to mask out the target token IDs that correspond to the instruction, as illustrated in figure 7.13. By masking out the LLM’s target token IDs corresponding to the instruction, the cross entropy loss is only computed for the generated response target IDs. Thus, the model is trained to focus on generating accurate responses rather than memorizing instructions, which can help reduce overfitting.\n",

For instance, the 2024 paper by Shi et al., [Instruction Tuning With Loss Over Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14394), demonstrated that not masking the instructions benefits the LLM performance (see appendix B for more details).

This dataset contains 52,002 entries, which is approximately 50 times more than those we used here, and most entries are longer. Thus, I highly recommend using a GPU to conduct the training, which will accelerate the fine-tuning process.

    "    - **Weight Decay**: Modifies the parameter update step to penalize large weights. It directly subtracts a portion of the weights from the update, effectively shrinking them towards zero. \n",
    "    - **L2 Regularization**: Modifies the loss function by adding a penalty term proportional to the squared magnitude of the weights. This penalty term increases the loss for large weights, making it more difficult for the model to learn large values. \n",
    "2. AdamW's Approach:\n",
    "    - AdamW implements weight decay by directly subtracting a scaled version of the weights from the parameter update, without changing the loss function. \n",
    "    - This ensures that the momentum and adaptive learning rates in Adam, which are crucial for efficient training, are not affected by the weight decay process. \n",
    "3. Mathematical Representation:\n",
    "Let's consider the following:\n",
    "- $\\theta_t$: The weights at iteration $t$. \n",
    "- $\\nabla L(\\theta_t)$: The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights at iteration $t$. \n",

    "- The first term ($- \\eta_t \\cdot \\nabla L(\\theta_t)$) is the standard gradient descent update. \n",
    "- The second term ($- \\eta_t \\cdot \\lambda \\cdot \\theta_t$) is the weight decay term. It subtracts a portion of the weights ($\\lambda \\cdot \\theta_t$) from the update, scaled by the learning rate ($\\eta_t$). \n",
    "- This direct subtraction ensures that the weights are gradually shrunk towards zero during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Advantages of AdamW:\n",
    "    - Consistent Regularization: AdamW applies weight decay directly to the parameters, ensuring consistent regularization regardless of the magnitude of the gradients. \n",
    "    - Improved Generalization: By effectively shrinking weights towards zero, AdamW can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. \n",

To evaluate test set responses in an automated fashion, we utilize an existing instruction-fine-tuned 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model developed by Meta AI. This model can be run locally using the open source Ollama application (https://ollama.com).\n",
